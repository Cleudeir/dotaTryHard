## Summary

This project, "Dota Try Hard," is a Next.js application displaying Dota 2 player rankings and match statistics.  It fetches data from a backend API, processes it, and renders interactive tables with filtering and sorting capabilities.  The application features region-specific rankings, individual player profile pages showing match history, and detailed match information.  The frontend uses React, React Bootstrap, and custom CSS modules for styling and structure.  The backend API is accessed through serverless functions.  The project utilizes several custom hooks and components for data management, display, and pagination.  Static site generation (SSG) with revalidation is employed for performance.
